```
figurestates = readgeotable("usastatelo.shp");
states.ElectionResults = randi(3,height(states),1); 
redBluePurple = [1 0 0; 0 0 1; .5 0 .5];
h = height(states);
faceColors = makesymbolspec("Polygon",    {'INDEX',[1 h],'FaceColor',redBluePurple(states.ElectionResults,:)});
geoshow(states,"DisplayType","polygon","SymbolSpec",faceColors)
